    "*Background: Text editing in the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is provided by an excellent JavaScript-based [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) text editor. This might be more detail than you want, but I'm a [vision scientist](http://vision.berkeley.edu/?p=2120) so I hope you'll indulge me. If you want to leave a comment, or see what else I've written, [go to the blogpost version](http://pirsquared.org/blog/notebook-blink.html)*\n",

    "The human visual system has a pre-cortical lag of roughly 50-90 ms after ([read more about P1][1]). \n",
    "\n",
    "That's how long it takes from something changing on the screen to cause an avalanche of photons to barrel towards your eyeball, be phototransduced and processed by several stages of cells in the retina, finally causing retinal ganglion cells to fire an action potential down their axons through the optic nerve, make its way to a processing relay station called the LGN, with those cells firing action potential down *their* axons, with those spikes finally ending up in the primary visual cortex. \n",

    "By ~150 ms, our brains have processed the visual input enough to [perform a non-trivial ammount of object recognition][2].\n",

When I look back at the scree, half of the time it will take **3 times longer** for me to get the information that I want (\"where's my cursor\") than if that cursor was clearly visible at all times. Now it's not always that bad, because sometimes my gaze will land on the screen and even though the cursor isn't visible, it appears in a few milliseconds, and so it takes **just as long** as if the cursor was there the whole time. But if I happen to be particularly unlucky (there's a reason I don't gamble), it can take **6 times longer**.\n",

    "IPython has a notion of profiles to allow for different kinds of configurations. If this is news to you, you've probably just been using the `default` profile and not known it. In the shell, run the ``ipython profile create`` command to be sure (don't worry, if you alreay have a profile, this won't overwrite it). Now ``ipython locate profile`` will tell you the directory which contains all of the configuration for the `default` profile."
